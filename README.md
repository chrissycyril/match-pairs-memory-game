## Introduction
The Memory Game Project is all about demonstrating the mastery of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The goal of the project is to build a browser-based card matching game(also known as Concentration).

The game randomly shuffles the cards. The player flips one card over to check the card symbol and then turns over a second card to find the corresponding card with the same symbol. If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over. A user wins once all cards have successfully been matched.
